It took place in 2013-2014 as a response to the government\u0027s decision to suspend an association agreement with the European Union. The protests were fueled by widespread frustration over corruption, human rights abuses, and the government\u0027s ties to Russia. The movement eventually grew into a massive demonstration demanding political reform and closer ties with Europe.\n\nThe Revolution of Dignity culminated in the ousting of then-President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014. This revolution set the stage for subsequent events, including the Russo-Ukrainian War and the ongoing conflict in the region.\n\n(Source: [Wikipedia - Euromaidan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War))",
